Python scripts for analysis are included.
Files descriptions are as follows:
ERAP2Pre-Processing.ipynb: Includes processing of big exome sequencing data using BCFtools, annotating genomic positions using GnomAD data and adding MAF calculated using PLINK in data.
ERAP2Annotation.ipynb: Includes annotation of gentoypes from 0|1 binary digits to A|G etc using information from REF and ALT alleles.
ERAP2haplotypes.ipynb: Includes detailed analysis of assembling haplotypes, calculating frequency in population and also the conversion of haplotypes to allotypes using protein consequences data.
ERAP2hapsICD10.ipynb: Includes haplotypes ICD10 disease association analysis.
ERAP2-haps Phylogenetics.ipnb: Includes multiple sequence alignment using clustalw (you have to download clustalw in your system first) and the phylogenetic tree analysis.
